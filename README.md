# TreeLikedCounter
the main counter increases when the subCounter is clicked but also decreases if the same subCounter is clicked, like mass social media like buttons.

:- it stores the value of the subCounter as 0 or 1, if the subCounter value reads 0 then the main counter increases but if the subCounter value reads 1 then the main subCounter decreases. The cool thing here is that the values 0 or 1 isn't stored in the localstorage but is in the browser itself that way it doesn't take up the storage of the user.
